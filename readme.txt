== Description ==

Easily link together your network of sites with the (SPYR) Network Bar.

This plugin was born out of the necessity to interlink our [Spyr Media](http://spyr.me) network. It was originally meant to be an in-house project, but once it was developed we figured everyone should benefit. So have at it!

You can see the plugin in action on some of our sites:

* [(in)SPYR Theme](http://in.spyr.me)
* [Marla's Paleo Porn](http://marlasarris.com)

== Installation ==

Setup is easy peasy.

1. After install, configure the plugin on the Spyr Media > Network Bar options page
1. Create a new menu in Appearance > Menus and attach it to the (SPYR) Network Bar Theme Location
1. Repeat on each of your network sites
1. Enjoy site crippling traffic numbers network-wide, the likes of which no one has ever seen (result not typical)
